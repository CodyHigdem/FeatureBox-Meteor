# FeatureBox-Meteor

The entire purpose of this package is to create a simple and easy to use feature voting box for new websites. Yeah you could write this up almost every time but I think it is kind of silly to do so. Why not have a place for people to just start listing off ideas for features. 

These packages use a combination of Aldeed's autoforms and schemas to create a simple and easy features and issues 'box'.

These are the current templates out there. Wire them up to either a route using packages like iron router or flow. Or embed them into the page you'd like to see them in.
